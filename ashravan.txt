Ashravan awoke to silence, a silence that no emperor should hear.
The Forgeries around him shimmered like candlelight, each rune
crafted by Shai’s brilliant hand. But something felt incomplete.
He could sense memories missing, stolen by the process that gave
him life again. Was he still Ashravan, or only her imitation?

He rose from his bed of silk and saw the empire’s dawn—
brighter, clearer, but distant. In the courtyard, ministers bowed,
though he sensed their doubt. They wondered: is he truly reborn?

At dusk, Shai appeared once more, eyes full of both triumph and
sorrow. “You are what you choose to be,” she said. “Not what I
restored.” And in that moment, Ashravan realized—his Forgery
wasn’t a lie. It was a second chance to be better than the man he was.
