Ashravan stood in the grand hall, his memories scattered like the shattered glass on the marble floor.
Shai had done what few dared—restored the Emperor’s soul. Yet within the woven threads of Forgery,
Ashravan sensed echoes of his former self—his guilt, his pride, his fear of death. 
He walked among courtiers who whispered his name with awe and doubt. 

At night, he felt the Forgery pulsing within him—an imitation of truth, yet alive with intention.
He dreamed of a shadow in the mirror, asking, “Are you truly restored, or merely rewritten?”
The question consumed him. He rode to the Shattered Plains, seeking answers from the ancient stones
that still remembered screams of forgotten kings.

When the Forgery began to fade, Ashravan saw Shai’s signature etched deep within his soul.
He realized that life, whether Forged or real, was still a chance—to change, to repent, to create meaning.
As the final stroke of Shai’s art began to unravel, Ashravan whispered, “I was dead once—but now I choose to live.”
The echo of that choice rewrote him anew.
